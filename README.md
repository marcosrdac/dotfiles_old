# My dotfiles

Here are the configuration files for my Arch Linux build. Currently I save this directory in *~/.dotfiles* and, when rebuilding my system, just send to a terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/marcosrdac/dotfiles -o ~/.dotfiles
```

and basically symlink all the files to their places inside ~/.


## To-do

  * make init.vim from nvim compatible to vim; and
  * see if I can securely upload my offlineimaprc.
