Working titles for this font were obvious things like "Crime Wave" and "Criminologist" and such along those lines. But then I decided it'd be cute to name it after somebody dead and latinate, which is common for serious typefaces but downright silly for a munged typewriter font. I like silly. Cesare Beccaria was an 18th-century Italian who wrote what is probably the first really important book on crime, see, so it all works together if you squint.

All that aside, I realized one day that I'd had fontmaking as a hobby for a couple of years now and still hadn't made any sort of typewriter font. Around the same time, I was doing a lot of work up at the public library downtown, including some typing, and Beccaria was born.

The ribbons on the library typewriters aren't THAT bad, of course; I exaggerated a little. But they're pretty rotten on some days! Since I built the font based on samples from a real typewriter, the character set is ALMOST a complete keyboard set - the couple of missing characters have been replaced by bullets.
