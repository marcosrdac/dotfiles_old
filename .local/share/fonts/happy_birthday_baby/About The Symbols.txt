This font family contains special symbols for programs that support opentype features. 

Type ** for the cupcake
Type ## for the balloon
Type >> for the Present
Type <3 for the heart
Type :) for the smiley 

Why aren't the special symbols working for me?

You may be using a program that does not support opentype features, such as ms paint, open office, libre office, gimp, etc.

Examples of programs that do support opentype features are: photoshop, illustrator, or microsoft word. If you are using one of these programs, make sure you have ligatures turned on.
Paint.net is the only free program that I know of that shows the symbols.

An alternative is to use my ding sets, as they contain all my special characters and should work in any program.

MF Dings contains the special symbols for this font.
